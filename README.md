- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code (optional).

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or compile the program using the command line.
3. Run the `car` class to start the program.

### Command Line Steps:
```bash
